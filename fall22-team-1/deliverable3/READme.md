# Information regarding our submission

The Team 5 repository consists of notes that we took and all of the deliverables, split into their respective folders. Each deliverable has increasing priority in its recentness and finalness, so for example, deliverable 5 contains the most recent report, deliverable 4 has the most recent combined dataset analysis, and deliverable 1 has the most updated individual dataset analysis.

Finally, here is the [recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IomwMsHYtb8BexI8euBAEoPiVwXWhF5-/view) to the final client presentation on Dec 9th. Our team lead, Amy Seedhom, presented for us, however the entire team worked to update the final report and slides for this presentation.
