### This is the culmination of all our work over the semester so far, except for the report which will be submitted in deliverable 5.
- Please note that not all the jupyter notebooks may display their output on GitHub itself, you will likely need to download and view each notebook for the full picture.
- To run, make sure you have all the requisite python packages installed. If any are missing, you can run pip install {package name here} to obtain them.
- Additionally, make sure that the paths to data are correct, and you should change them if necessary
- If you are running this on Google Colab, you will need to take extra steps to connect the notebook to your drive and other sources, otherwise you should be able to run it as is.
