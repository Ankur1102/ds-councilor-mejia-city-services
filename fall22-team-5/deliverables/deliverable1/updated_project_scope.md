- What is the project focus/overall goal?
  - To figure out how city funding has permeated and how business licenses have been distributed across the Greater Boston Area. In addition, we will be looking at whether there are any disparities betwewen access to resources across the city.
- What type of data will you collect or be analyzing?
  - We will be looking at Census data, ACS community service data, 311 hotline service dataset, city funding dataset.
- What are potential limitations of the project?
  - A potential limitation of the project is that the datasets do not have enough in common with each other, making it hard to extrapolate any findings or significant claims from analysis.
  - Another limitation, specific to the business license data, is that they are all stored with different features. This makes it difficult to draw conclusions along all types of licenses, and the conclusions have to be mostly license specific.
- Why is this project important or Why did you choose this project?
  - I believe that this project is important because it has the potential to impact so many people and businesses in the city of Boston, and to decrease inequality between social classes and ethnicities living in Boston.
